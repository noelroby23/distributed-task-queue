"""
Data models shared by the API, store, and worker processes.

The system moves the same task record through several layers:

    client -> FastAPI -> Redis queue/hash -> worker -> Redis hash -> client

Pydantic models give us one contract for that data. FastAPI uses them for
request validation and response serialization, while the rest of the codebase
uses the same field names to avoid drift between layers.
